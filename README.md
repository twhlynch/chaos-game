# Chaos Game

Generates a Sierpinski triangle in the browser using the chaos game

The chaos game is a mathematical technique that involves creating fractal patterns by repeatedly plotting points in a pattern governed by a set of rules.

You start by selecting three points in a plane to form a triangle. Then, you choose a random starting point inside the triangle. From there, you randomly choose one of the three vertices of the triangle and plot a new point halfway between the starting point and the chosen vertex.

You continue this process, each time selecting a new vertex at random and plotting a new point halfway between the previous point and the new vertex. As you plot more and more points, a fractal pattern begins to emerge.
